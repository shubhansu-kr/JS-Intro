// In this lab, you have to build a JS object.

// This object should be named 'myOwnObject'
// You should have a property called myAge which should be a number
// You should have a property called myName which should be a string
// You should have another property call myFriend which should be an 
// object that should include myFriendAge as a property with their age 
// as a number

// All the best!

const myOwnObject = {
    myAge: 18,
    myName: 'Shubhansu',
    myFriend: {
        myFriendAge: 19
    }
}
